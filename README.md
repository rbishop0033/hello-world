# hello-world
New repository for practicing GitHub with CodeLouisville.
I am a second time CodeLouisville student. I completed the SD1 course last year and am looking to go through the program once again. It was an exciting program and I learned a lot from it. I am excited to be back involved and hopefully eventually make the career change into a more tech-adjacent role.
